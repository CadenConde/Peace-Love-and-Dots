# RockSite

RockSite is a website developed for a small business owner selling hand-painted rocks on Etsy. This project features a full ordering system integrated with PayPal, allowing users to purchase items securely. The backend provides functionality for product management and order tracking. The site was built by a team of four, including myself.
